# Starter express app template

This backend starter pack is taken from a COSC052, a class I took in the spring. Here is the link for where I pulled the starter pack/followed instructions from: [https://brunchlabs.notion.site/SA6-Kahoot-API-f9e5bbc269654c918a14b0860ab510b7 ](url)

Elements of the starter pack:
* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules
