        <h1>CS61 FINAL PROJECT</h1>
        <h2>California House Prices Database</h2>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to Paige and Sofia's COSC 61 final project site. For this project, we chose to examine California housing data by block. 
          We used <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price' rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, an online database tool, to acquire our data.
          We created a database from this data which this site references and queries. You can read more about the database we created on our <a href='https://github.com/sofiapjayaswal/cs61_final/wiki' rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a>.
          Our site has two main features: Analytics and Explore. To navigate to a section, click the buttons on the 
          upper section of this page. Our analytics page features graphs and charts weâ€™ve generated from the data. Our Explore page 
          features an interactive map where users can filter their view of California housing information. Thank you for visiting our page! </p>
